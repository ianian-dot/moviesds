Analysing and exploring a dataset of 5000+ movies, from this [Kaggle site](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset/code)

Being a movie junkie, I have a personal interest in exploring this dataset. Some possible points of interests can be

- Big directors and their genres 
- Have Ratings changed over time 
- Is there an interaction between main and side genre that gives higher Ratings 
- Censorship over time 
- Relationships between actors and directors
