Analysing and exploring a dataset of 5000+ movies, from this [Kaggle site](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset/code)

Being a movie junkie, I have a personal interest in exploring this dataset. Some possible points of interests can be

- Big directors and their genres 
- Have Ratings changed over time 
- Is there an interaction between main and side genre that gives higher Ratings 
- Censorship over time 
- Relationships between actors and directors

Plots used in the Rmd:

![Distribution of ratings](https://github.com/ianian-dot/moviesds/assets/59313290/06a1f9d1-bad9-4554-9a48-b4350a046fa8){ width=50% }
![Relationship between total gross and rating, facted by genre](https://github.com/ianian-dot/moviesds/assets/59313290/5cef4ddc-a148-4fc0-8ec7-40a40d4cf880){ width=50% }
